<hr>
<p>This is my second rather large project. I gave up unnecessary libraries, such as Jquery and others. I tried to structure the code. I used gulp, the layout is valid, cross-browser, adaptive. Of course, I used the SASS preprocessor(SCSS). By the way, this site has received a rating of 100 out of 100 on Google pagespeed! Even for phones. I am very happy about it. In general, you will see all the chips directly on the website and in the code, good luck)</p>
